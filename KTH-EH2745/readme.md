# EH2745 - Computer Applications in Power Systems

## Royal Institute of Technology KTH - Stockholm

The aim of the course is to train the students in developing computer systems for advanced planning, operation and control of electric power systems.

Block one includes analysis and modeling of the need for Information exchange for power system control. The aim is to train the students to analyze different perspectives on information necessary for power system control. The project assignment in the block includes implementation of a simple information model for the exchange of data on power systems.

Block two includes basics in programming techniques and computer science focusing on machine learning methods with applications in power systems. The project assignment in the block consists of developing machine learning algorithms for forecasting.

__This repository contains the completed assignments in EH2745:__

- [x] ASSIGNMENT 1 - _The first assignment involves reading and parsing a CIM data file representing a small power system. The student is then tasked with storing the data and analyzing it to generate a model of the grid using the Pandapower toolbox._
- [x] ASSIGNMENT 2 - _The second assignment the student is asked to generate a times series of power system measurements, analyze the states in the data using unsupervised learning and then use the identified states to classify new measurements._
