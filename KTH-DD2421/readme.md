# DD2421 - Machine Learning

## Royal Institute of Technology KTH - Stockholm

The course addresses the question how to enable computers to learn from past experiences. It introduces the field of machine learning describing a variety of learning paradigms, algorithms, theoretical results and applications.

The following topics in machine learning and computational intelligence are covered in detail:

- nearest neighbour classifier
- decision trees
- bias and the trade-off of variance
- regression
- probabilistic methods
- bayesian learning
- support vector machines
- artificial neural networks
- ensemble methods
- dimensionality reduction
- subspace methods.
